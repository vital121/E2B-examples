# E2B
E2B gives your agent a full cloud development environment that's sandboxed. That means:

- Access to Linux OS
- Using filesystem (create, list, and delete files and dirs)
- Run processes
- Sandboxed - you can run any code
- Access to the internet

These cloud environments are meant to be used for agents. Like a sandboxed playgrounds, where the agent can do whatever it wants.
